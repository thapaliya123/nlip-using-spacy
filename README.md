According [spaCy documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101), spaCy is a free , open-source library for advanced Natural Language processing a.k.a NLP in python. If you're working with a lot text, you'll eventually want to know more about it. spaCy is designed specifically for production use and helps you build applications that process and "understand" large volumes of text. 

This `repository` includes beginner to intermediate spaCy guidelines which is basically a summary of [spaCy documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101). For your ease, I have created [pdfs](https://github.com/thapaliya123/nlp-using-spacy/tree/master/pdf), [notebooks](https://github.com/thapaliya123/nlp-using-spacy/tree/master/notebook) which includes detailed about `spaCy` and a separate [python module](https://github.com/thapaliya123/nlp-using-spacy/blob/master/text_preprocessing_module.py) which includes basic text preprocessing steps.

**Users Guide**  
```Simply clone the repository and according to your preference:  
  - Read `pdfs`
  - Walkthrough `Jupyter Notebooks`
  - Execute `Python file`
  ```
  
_`Note:` you need to install spaCy and other libraries inorder to execute python module._
